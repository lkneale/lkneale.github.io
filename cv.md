My path to joining the University of Washington has not been straightforward. I started my academic journey as an Industrial and Operations Engineering ([IOE](http://www.engin.umich.edu/ioe)) student at the University of Michigan. After a senior year capstone project at the University of Michigan hospital, I started to develop an understanding of how information systems, combined with operations management, can be used to greatly enhance healthcare operations, healthcare quality, and patient satisfaction. 

After working briefly in healthcare, it was evident that information systems in healthcare would only grow in significance. Therefore, after the University of Michigan, I decided to deepen my understanding of information systems management and received a Masters of Science in Information Systems Technology ([MS-IST](http://business.gwu.edu/programs/specialized-masters/m-s-information-systems-technology/)) from The George Washington University. This coursework allowed me to deepen my understanding of the information systems life cycle including the design and development of systems, the importance of significant testing and evaluation, implementation, and maintenance. 

Since graduate school, I have worked with clinical teams to improve healthcare by using process improvement methodologies, such as Lean or Six Sigma, to identify improvements that will meet the needs of the stakeholders. Often, information systems are used to help stakeholders make and sustain process improvements. 

As an informaticist, I believe that information systems are a powerful tool that can be used to make improvements; however, my industrial engineering background and professional experience has taught me that the workflows, business rules, and other process changes that surround information systems are even more important to achieving required results. 

My work at the University of Washington explores how technology can help transition patients and families from acute to post-acute care. This is an increasingly important care transition, especially for the millions of community-dwelling older adults in the United States. I believe that information systems can help share clinical information, coordinate care, and help individuals maintain self-management routines at home. To achieve this, not only does the industry have to understand the technical challenges with these solutions, but also the expectations of the stakeholders (clinicians, caregivers, patients and administrators) and examine the workflows that allow these tools to be accepted and used.
