I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics in the School of Medicine at the University of Washington ([UW BHI](https://www.bhi.washington.edu/)) in Seattle, WA.

I study how technology can help older adults coordinate care and share health information with their care team. My dissertation is exploring the usability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of personal health records with older adults transitioning from the hospital to home health. I plan to graduate in the summer of 2017.
