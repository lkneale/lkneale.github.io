### University of Washington Tacoma 
During the summer of 2016, I taught a MBA class called Healthcare Information Systems for the University of Washington Tacoma. In this course we covered the history of healthcare information systems and relevant policy, current uses of information technology, and the students explored how health information technology could help solve a problem in a healthcare domain. Although my class was small (7 students), there was significant diversity in professional experience, age, and student goals. this course was 4 credits, and I provided 2,000 hours of instruction in the 4-week summer quarter. I was responsible for all course material, course content, grading, and student feedback. Below is a sample of some of the course material.

#### Sample Class Materials
Students worked in groups to identify the requirements for the new position, and then were given the list of candidates to choose someone to hire. I facilitated a discussion around why specific requirements were chosen, and how the candidates did or did not meet these requirements. This was the conclusion of a course-long case study, and we used this final project to discuss the changing role of health information system leadership in hospitals and healthcare.
