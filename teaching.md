#### Sample Class Materials
This class activity was used in the final lecture of the course to conclude a course-long case study. I used this final project to discuss the changing roles of health information system leadership iin response to the changing landscape of US healthcare and information systems. 

There were two parts of this activity. First, students formed groups and were given the first page of the PDF below. Students were asked to help Emma develop a list of requirements for the open position based on course material, the case study, and supplemental readings. After requirements were developed, I facilitated a short class discussion on why specific requirements were chosen. 

After the discussion, students got back into their groups and were given the list of potential candidates (second page of the PDF). Students discussed the merits of each candidate, and the ways in which he or she meet their stated requirements. After candidates were chosen, I facilitated a final discussion on why specific candidates were chosen, how future candidates could be more prepared to meet the health system needs, and how workforce development could prepare future leaders to take on the challenging roles in healthcare information systems leadership.
