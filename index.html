    I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics in the
    School of Medicine at the University of Washington (<a href="https://www.bhi.washington.edu/">UW BHI</a>)
    in Seattle, WA.
  </p>
  <p>
    I study how technology can help older adults coordinate care and share health information with
    their care team. My dissertation is exploring the usability, feasibility, and preliminary
    effectiveness of personal health records with older adults transitioning from the hospital to
    home health. I plan to graduate in the summer of 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to joining the University of Washington in 2013, I was a healthcare consultant with an
    expertise in clinical quality improvement, systems engineering, and publicly reported quality
    measures.
