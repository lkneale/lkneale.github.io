    I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics in the
    School of Medicine at the University of Washington <b>(<a href="https://www.bhi.washington.edu/">UW BHI</a>)</b>
    in Seattle, WA.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research seeks to understand how to optimize healthcare information systems using a socio-technology model of analysis.
    I am paticularly focused on how information systems can support older adults, their caregivers, and healthcare providers that
    care for these populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently a member of the University of Washington's <b><a href="http://health-e.info/">HEALTH-E</a> </b> lab. 
    HEALTH-E is an interdisciplinary group of researchers committed to exploring systems that support older adults 
    and promote independent aging using innovative technology tools.
