I work to improve healthcare services by collaborating with patients, families, and clinicans to document, analyze, and improve system issues. I especially enjoy working to understand how older adult care can be improved through well-designed technology and clincial process improvements.

<p>
I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington in 2017. My research experience included the domains of human computer interaction (HCI), gerontology, and informatics. I also have a degree in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan (2006) and Masters of Science in Information Systems Technology from the George Washington Univeristy (2008).

In addition, I have worked in clincial quality improvement leading teams of clincians to improve clinical workflows, patient safety, and patient experience.
