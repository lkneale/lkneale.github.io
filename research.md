I enjoy working with clinicans, administrators, patients, and families to improve the care experience. I also enjoy collecting and analyzing clinical data from healthcare claims databases, electornic medical records, and publically reported databases to understand challenges and areas of improvement with current care delivery.

  ### Improving Care Transitions for Older Adults ###
  <b>Overview</b>
  <p>
  Care transitions are some of the most vulnerable times for older adult patients and their families. This is especially true when older adults are being transferred from the hospital to another level of care, often with new diagnoses and care routines. Over my professional and academic career, I have worked to improve the clincial handoffs and involvement of patient and families in care cooridnation. Below are two examples of recent projects that I have led in this area.
  </p>
  <b> Example Project 1: Evaluating the Effectiveness	of PHRs for Home Health Encounters </b>
  <p>
  I used the Home Health Value Based Purchasing Dataset and longitudinal interviews from patients and caregivers to evaluate how PHRs could improve care delivery during home health services following a hospitalization. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Methods/Skills: Interviews (individual and group), instrument development and administration, R, RedCap
  </p>
  <p>
  Impact/Conclusions: Many issues with care cooridnation among homebound older adults were uncovered during these studies. Using technology to bridge the gap between patients, caregivers, home health nursing staff, primary care providers, and specialty care physicians was a valuable exercise for many patients and families. The poor design of current PHRs and user experience issues prevented many older adults and their caregivers from using these tools to their fullest extent. 
  </p>
  <b> Example Project 2: Managing the University of Chicago Medicine 30-Day Readmission Reduction Program
<p>
  I led several projects to reduce the 30-day readmission rate on key patient populations at the University of Chicago Medicine. One project specifically looked at the care transition from UCM to skilled nursing facilities. Our team enacted several procedures to improve care coordination and handoff between the facilities. These procedures included sign off from the geriatric medicine team before discharge, ensuring continuity of pain management plans and medication availability prior to transfer, and clincial process improvements to reduce night and weekend transfers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Methods/skills: Clinical workflow and data analysis, project management, meeting facilitation, and Lean Healthcare techniques
  </p>
  <p>
    Impact: We saw an immediate impact on perceived patient safety, clinican coordination, and nursing confidence at discharge.
