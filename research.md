I enjoy working with healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, and administrators to understand how care transitions can be improved through systems engineering and well-designed information technology. My expertise is evaluating how existing technologies can be optimized to better meet the needs of the healthcare system. For me, this includes understanding the needs and perspectives of the entire care team, evaluating how these needs could be met (through technology and/or systems changes), and developing recommendations.
